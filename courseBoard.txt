HTML
    Content Models in HTML:
        Block-level elements:
            Render to begin on a new line.
            May contain inline or other block-level elements.
            - <div></div>

        Inline elements:
            Render on the same line.
            May only contain other inline elements.
            - <span></span>

    Semantic tags:
        - <header></header>
        - <section></section>
        - <article></article>
        - <aside></aside> contains information that relates to the main
        topic, i.e. related posts
        - <footer></footer> 

    Entity references:
        - (<): &lt;
        - (>): &gt;
        - (&): &amp;
        - (Â©): &copy;
        -(non-breaking space): &nbsp;
        -("/"): &quot;

CSS
    Element Selector --> i.e: 
        p{
            css declaration;
        }
    
    Class Selector --> i.e:
        .blue{
            css declaration;
        }
    how to use it? -> <div class = "blue">...</div>

    Id Selector --> i.e:
        #name{
            css declaration;
        }
    how to use it? -> <p id = "name">...</p>

    Grouping selectors i.e.: 
        div, .blue{
            css declaration;
        }
    
    Element with class selector i.e:
        p.big{
            css declaration;
        }
        this combination affects only the <p> tags of the "big" class.

    Child Selector i.e:
        article > p{
            css declaration;
        }
        Every element <p> that is a direct child of <article> element.

    Descendant Selector i.e:
        article p{
            css declaration;
        }
        Every <p> that is inside (at any level) an <article> element.

    Pseudo-Class Selector i.e:
        selector:pseudo-class{
            css declaration;
        }
        
    Styling text: common tags
        font-family
        color
        font-style
        font-weight
        font-size
        text-transform
        text-align

    *{
        css declaration;
    }
    This type of selector allow us make declarations without inheritance.
    The declaration will affect all the elements inside the document.

    Positioning elements:

        Static Positioning: Normal document flow. Default for all, except html,
        (Positions offsets are ignored).

        Relative Positioning: Element is positioned relative to its position
        in normal document flow.

        Floating Elements:
            - Floating elements can produce very flexible layouts.
            - Floats are taken out of normal document flow .
            - Floats don't have vertical margin collapse.
            - To resume normal document flow, use the -clear- property.

    Media Querys: it's an special way to filter what declarations should have
    a kind of device.
        
        Basic syntax: 
            @media(media feature){ ... } or
            @media(media feature) logical opeator (media feature){ ... }

Bootstrap

    Bootstrap grid system basics:
        col-SIZE-SPAN
            col --> to indicate is a column
            SIZE --> the size of each column (xs, sm, md, lg)
            SPAN --> how many columns element should span (1 through 12)
